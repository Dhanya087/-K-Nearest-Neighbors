# Fruit Type Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project demonstrates a machine learning model that predicts the type of fruit based on its weight, color, and texture. The model is built using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and includes an interactive web application powered by Streamlit to visualize the predictions.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the type of fruit based on its attributes such as weight, color, and texture. We utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the fruits. The project includes:

- Data preprocessing and encoding categorical variables
- Training the KNN model
- An interactive Streamlit app to input fruit attributes and visualize predictions

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fruit-type-prediction.git
    cd fruit-type-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To run the Streamlit app and predict fruit types:

1. Ensure you are in the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```

2. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the app.

## Features
- Predict fruit types based on weight, color, and texture
- Interactive interface using Streamlit for inputting fruit attributes and viewing predictions
- Easy-to-use interface for inputting data and viewing results
